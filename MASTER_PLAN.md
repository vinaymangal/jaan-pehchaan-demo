## Copy-Paste Development Instructions

### 🔧 For Non-Programmer Developer:

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE:
1. **NEVER edit code** - only replace complete files
2. **NEVER mix old and new code** - always delete all content first
3. **NEVER attempt debugging** - if something breaks, ask for complete new file
4. **NEVER modify file names** - keep exact naming as provided

#### ✅ CORRECT File Update Process:
1. **Open target file** in VS Code or text editor
2. **Select ALL content** (Ctrl+A) - ensure everything is selected
3. **Delete everything** (Delete key) - file should be completely empty
4. **Copy new code** from provided artifact (click copy button)
5. **Paste into empty file** (Ctrl+V) - file now has only new content
6. **Save file** (Ctrl+S) - changes saved to disk
7. **Test immediately** using Live Server or browser file open

#### 📱 Testing Checklist After Each Update:
- [ ] **Open in Chrome browser** for best compatibility
- [ ] **Test mobile view** (F12 → device toolbar → iPhone/Android)
- [ ] **Check all buttons work** and navigation functions properly
- [ ] **Verify animations** and interactive elements respond
- [ ] **Test guided tour** if page supports ?tour=true parameter
- [ ] **Confirm mobile container** shows 430px width on desktop

### 🚨 Emergency Help for Broken Pages:
If page stops working after update:
1. **Don't panic** - very common with copy-paste development
2. **Don't try to fix code** - you're not a programmer
3. **Ask for help** with message: "Page [filename] is broken after update, need complete working replacement"
4. **Provide error description** - what you see vs. what you expect
