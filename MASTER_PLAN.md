Jaan Pehchaan App Development Prompt
App Concept Overview
Create a social networking assistance app called "Jaan Pehchaan" (meaning "Know & Recognize" in Hindi/Urdu) that connects users with their extended network for instant help and support.
Core Purpose: Enable users to quickly find and request help from people in their network (up to 4 degrees of separation) during urgent situations or everyday needs.
Key Philosophy: "Your network is your net worth" - leveraging human connections for mutual assistance.
The Founder's Vision & Core USP
The Universal Problem
We've all experienced this frustrating scenario: You're stuck at a government office, bank, school, or any institution, struggling through bureaucratic processes, waiting in endless queues, or facing unresponsive staff. After hours of difficulty and hardship, you finally get your work done. Then, days later, a colleague casually mentions, "Oh, my uncle works at that same government office" or "My cousin is a manager at that bank."
The Moment of Realization: "What if I had known this connection beforehand? How much easier would my life have been?"
The Core Innovation
Jaan Pehchaan solves this exact problem by creating a "Connection Discovery Engine" that reveals hidden pathways in your extended network BEFORE you need them.
The Magic Moment: Imagine walking into any institution and instantly knowing: "My friend's brother-in-law works here" or "My colleague's neighbor is a senior officer here."
The Unique Value Proposition
•	Proactive Connection Discovery: Find connections before you need them, not after
•	Institutional Mapping: Know who works where in your extended network
•	Preemptive Problem Solving: Avoid bureaucratic hassles by leveraging existing relationships
•	Hidden Network Revelation: Discover surprising connections you never knew existed
Target User Profile
•	Primary: Non-technical users who need simple, intuitive interfaces
•	Secondary: People who frequently need quick assistance or want to help others
•	Use Case: Emergency situations, professional help, local recommendations, skill sharing
First-Time User Experience & Onboarding
Simplified Login Flow
1.	Google Login: Simple one-tap authentication as primary method (no complex registration forms)
2.	Future Enhancement: Aadhaar OTP-based KYC authentication once app gains traction
3.	Location-First Approach: Map view showing user's current location as the first screen after login
Trust-Building Through First Connection
•	Smart Contact Selection: 
o	Prompt user to invite 5 contacts from phonebook
o	AI-powered suggestion of top contacts based on call frequency analysis
o	Emphasis on first connection acceptance as trust anchor
